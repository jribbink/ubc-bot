# ubc-bot
Bot for UBC Discords

# Overview
I designed this as a project for fun given the online-learning situation of 2020 in the brave-new-world of COVID-19.  I picture it as a bot that provides a variety of educational related services ultimately from the given APIs and platforms integrated with the general online learning environment.  It's very open-ended, but it's a great project to put basic Typescript skills to the test!
